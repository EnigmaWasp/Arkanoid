# Arkanoid
his is in general, probably my first program working with graphics. Before that, I was in DOS, and then I saw what are Delphi, Builder, so it immediately seemed that the resources are endless, the possibilities are unlimited. The most common arkanoid. Two levels, but I do not have the patience to pass the first one.
